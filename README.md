Notice
-------

This project is no longer in development. It was just a quick side
project to learn jQuery/JavaScript and for use in another side project I
was working on. If you want a really awesome notification plugin for
jQuery that is actively maintained check out https://github.com/needim/noty.
You are free to still fork, favorite, and create issues and I will still try to
entertain the issues I can. I will be leaving this project in this form, which
is a very basic, but I believe it is still an effective jQuery notification
system that is simple to use. Thank you for your support.

Ambiance - jQuery Notification Plugin
=============

This is my first plugin for jQuery and I decided to try and make this after
playing around with jQuery for a bit. I just learned jQuery so please feel free
to let me know any issues there are with the plugin. Thank you!

Download of Files
-------

The files are located in the `assets` folder of this repository. I have it
organized so that this can also be the demonstration page for the Github page.
The download links are also included on the documentation page which you can go
to below.

Documentation and Demonstrations
-------

Go to http://www.richardhsu.me/jquery.ambiance to view the documentation
and demonstrations. The page also has a description of all the parameters and
of course examples of different parameter settings.

When you call the function it sets off the notification so you can use this at
the end of an AJAX call or just on click events as shown in the demonstration
page. That's it! Feel free to contact me with any feedback, comments, issues,
or fork the project and pull request with changes! Thanks!

Installation
-------

I'm sure most people know how to install jQuery plugins but if you don't all
you need to do is include the CSS `jquery.ambiance.css` and JavaScript
`jquery.ambiance.js` files in your website directory and properly link them in
your website templates. Feel free to contact me with questions.
